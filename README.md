Basic-Brain-Anatomy
============

In this tutorial

At the end of this tutorial I hope you are be able to:

1.  Know the meanings some fancy anatomical landmarking terms medial, lateral, caudal...
2.  Be able to name the main cortical and subcortial structures of the brain.
3.  Name the main functions that are associated with the different parts of the brain.

Fancy anatomical words
============

When talking about brains (and anatomy in general), we use some fancy anatomical words to describe things.  They describe the relative positions of structures in the brain.  These words will tell you about the position of a structure in 3D space, and are divided into 3 axes.

1.  Front-to-back (from your eyes to the back of your head)
2.  Outside-to-inside (from your ear to the center of your head)
3.  Top-to-bottom (from the top of your head to your neck)

Of course we can't just use those words, because then it would be easy.  Instead we use:

1.  Anterior-posterior, or caudal-rostral (Front-Back)
2.  Lateral-medial (outside-inside)
3.  Dorsal-ventral, or superior-inferior (top-bottom)

So let's say there was a structure called the cingulate cortex (there is).  I can use these terms to subdivide the this structure to specify what part of it I'm talking about.  So if I said the _anterior_ cingulate cortex, you would know that I was talking about the part of the cingulate that's closer to your eyes.  If I said the _posterior_ cingulate cortex, you would know that I was talking about the part of the cingular that's closer to the back of your head.

I can also use these terms together and say things like _dorsal anterior_ cingulate cortex, and in that case I'd mean the part that was close to the front and top of your head.

Some of these words are kind of tricky to remember.  Here's some tricks that I know.  

1.  Medial.  Sounds like 'middle' (kind of) and that's what it means.
2.  Superior.  The best (so it's higher).
3.  Inferior.  The worst (so it's lower).
4.  Dorsal-Ventral.  Dorsal fin.  The dorsal fin is on top of the dolphin or whale, so dorsal means upper. 
5.  Anterior-posterior.  Use alphabetical ordering - *A*nterior is in the front, *p*osterior is in the back.
6.  Rostral-caudal.  Can't help ya there, sorry.
