Basic (human) brain anatomy
============

In this tutorial

At the end of this tutorial I hope you will be able to:

1.  Know the meanings some fancy anatomical landmarking terms like medial, dorsal, and caudal...
2.  Be able to name the main cortical and subcortial structures of the brain.
3.  Name the main functions that are associated with the different parts of the brain.

Fancy anatomical words
============

When talking about brains (and anatomy in general), we use some fancy anatomical words to describe things.  They describe the relative positions of structures in the brain.  These words will tell you about the position of a structure in 3D space, and are divided into 3 axes.

1.  Front-to-back (from your eyes to the back of your head)
2.  Outside-to-inside (from your ear to the center of your head)
3.  Top-to-bottom (from the top of your head to your neck)

Of course we can't just use those words, because then it would be easy.  Instead we use:

1.  Anterior-posterior, or caudal-rostral (Front-Back)
2.  Lateral-medial (outside-inside)
3.  Dorsal-ventral, or superior-inferior (top-bottom)

So let's say there was a structure called the cingulate cortex (there is).  I can use these terms to subdivide the this structure to specify what part of it I'm talking about.  So if I said the _anterior_ cingulate cortex, you would know that I was talking about the part of the cingulate that's closer to your eyes.  If I said the _posterior_ cingulate cortex, you would know that I was talking about the part of the cingular that's closer to the back of your head.

I can also use these terms together and say things like _dorsal anterior_ cingulate cortex, and in that case I'd mean the part that was close to the front and top of your head.

Some of these words are kind of tricky to remember.  Here's some tricks that I used when I was learning.

1.  Medial.  Sounds like 'middle' (kind of) and that's what it means.
2.  Superior.  The best (so it's higher).
3.  Inferior.  The worst (so it's lower).
4.  Dorsal-Ventral.  Dorsal fin.  The dorsal fin is on top of the dolphin or whale, so dorsal means upper. 
5.  Anterior-posterior.  Use alphabetical ordering - **A**nterior is in the front, **p**osterior is in the back.
6.  Rostral-caudal.  If you're familiar with animal terms, you might know that "rostral" means towards the beak (or nose/head, in our case), and "caudal" means towards the tail.

Main structures
============

You can divide the parts of the brain into two main subregions.  Cortical, and subcortial.  Cortical refers to _cerebral cortex_, which is the outer later of the human brain (and some vertebrates like mammals).  If you've ever heard the term "grey matter" before, this is the part of the brain that we're talking about.  Subcortical means just what it sounds like - structures below the cortex.  

Let's begin by dividing up the cortex into some chunks, which we will call _lobes_.  The _frontal lobe_ is in the front.  It's pretty big, and pretty huge in humans relative to other animals and is thought to be one of the structures that makes us smart.  Posterior to that is the _parietal lobe_, which is also pretty big in humans relative to other animals.  The parietal cortex is called an _association area_ because it's smack dab in the middle of a bunch of of structures, and it integrates signals from those areas to make complicated stuff like math and spatial skills possible (more on that in another tutorial).  All the way at the back, posterior and ventral to the parietal cortex, is the _occipital lobe_.  The occipital lobe is responsible for handling visual input and making sense of what your eyes see.  Have we missed anything?  Yes we have.  On the lateral sides, inferior to the parietal and motor cortex, we have the _temporal lobes_.  These help us with processing auditory input, and language too.

Check out the diagrams below with the main cortical structures labelled (thanks wikipedia).
